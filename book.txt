The cause of poor performance in machine learning is either overfitting or underfitting the data.

In this post, you will discover the concept of generalization in machine learning and the problems of overfitting and underfitting that go along with it.

Kick-start your project with my new book Master Machine Learning Algorithms, including step-by-step tutorials and the Excel Spreadsheet files for all examples.
